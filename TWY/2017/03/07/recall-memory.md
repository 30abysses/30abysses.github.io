# 學習：記憶喚回(memory recall)

這篇是就記憶喚回(memory recall) 的閱讀筆記整理。


##  實用資訊

* 記憶喚回的種類有：
  * 自由喚回(free recall) ：在無提示的狀態下，以任意順序喚回記憶。
  * 提示喚回(cued recall) ：以提示喚回記憶。
  * 序列喚回(serial recall) ：在無提示的狀態下，以特定順序喚回記憶。
* 記憶喚回的理論模型：
  * 先蒐尋記憶再辨認出正確的資訊
  * 由背景環境提示而喚回記憶
* 記憶喚回能力會受到系列位置效應(serial position effect)影響：
  * primacy effect: 最先看到的東西，印像會比較深刻。
  * recency effect: 最近看到的東西，印像會比較深刻。
* 測試效應(testing effect)：與「只進行記憶編碼」相比，「進行記憶編碼後，
  輔以記憶喚回練習」，更能幫助記憶的形成。
* 序列喚回長期／短期記憶是不同的過程：
  * 序列喚回長期記憶是將資訊整體喚回。
  * 序列喚回短期記憶則是依靠資訊本身的同質性、順序（在序列中的位置、前後
    相鄰的資訊）來重組資訊序列。

---

* 專注(attention) 似乎僅對記憶編碼有顯著影響。
  * 人類對正面／負面（也就是非中性的）字詞、不尋常、不平常的聲音、語言的
    反應較大，進而影響記憶喚回過程。這是演化出來的「以情緒波動幅度篩選記
    憶的重要性」的機制。
* 動機(motivation)對記憶編碼、喚回機制本身沒有顯著影響；動機取決於「對成
  功的定義」，會影響人的目標選擇，進而反映在行為上。
* 干擾(interference)對短期記憶的負面影響顯著；對長期記憶的影響較小。
* 背景(context) ，從物理環境接收到的感官資訊（氣味、聲音、溫度、氣流、亮
  度、情緒），到抽象語意的「上下文」都可以幫助加強記憶編碼喚回的過程。
  * 古柯鹼、安非他命、咖啡因有提昇記憶喚回功率的效果，但長期使用會讓神經
    受損。
* 性別(gender)
  * 女性在情景記憶(episodic memory) 表現較男性強，在工作、即時、語意記憶
    上，兩性之間無明顯差異。
  * 一研究實驗指出，由女性演講的資訊讓人更容易記住，原因可能是女性的聲音
    高低變化比較明顯，所以讓聽眾的大腦更能注意到她以語調高低強調的字詞。
  * 女性較易記得非語言的記憶提示（手勢、姿勢）、溝通對像的聲音。
  * 男性較易記得字面上的意義、事實資訊；不易記得溝通對像的聲音。
  * 男女皆會因溝通對像表現出來的情緒（聲調）波動而有更深刻的印像。
* 飲食、運動，除了宏觀上對身體健康的影響，運動對海馬迴(hippocampus) 也有
  顯著的影響，而海馬迴是形成記憶的重要部位。

---

* 後設認知(metacognition) 的重要性在於「觀察自己以察覺自己思緒上的錯誤、
  弱點，進而有意識的修正、改善自己思緒過程」的能力。
* 記憶術(mnemonic)是針對資訊的特性，找出容易記憶的方式（例如，電話號碼，
  分成小節會比一次記一長串好記。）
* 非自主記憶喚回(involuntary memory retrieval)：
  * Involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) retrieval:  受感官、思緒影
    響而回想起的記憶。
  * Involuntary semantic memory retrieval (ISM):  與 IAM  相似，但想起的
    是更為零碎、客觀事實／資訊的記憶。
* 假記憶(false memory)，例如洗腦的 generation effect, 或他人的暗示的
  misinformation effect.
* 面貌優勢(face advantage)，與一個人的聲音相比，他的面貌更容易讓觀眾記得
  他傳達的資訊。


##  心得感想

由「專注、背景（環境）、非自主記憶喚回」可知，為了提高學習效率，「專注」
是最重要的。為了提昇專注，必須適當地選擇「背景（環境）」，以降低
「非自主記憶喚回」（分心）的機率。

善用「測試效應、干擾」；在學習一個段落之後，利用「干擾」（散散步、做做別
的事）來刻意擾亂短期記憶，輔以自由／提示／序列喚回的練習，平衡運用大腦的
（長期）記憶編碼、喚回的過程，幫助形成長期記憶。

動機取決於「對成功的定義」，是故，若「以考試分數量化成功」，就會反應在學
習的心態與行為上。

飲食均衡、作息正常、多運動。

**小心「認知上不自覺的錯誤」**，例如「假記憶」（洗腦、暗示），或著是

易言之，不自覺地讓「士兵」的情緒心態主宰自己的思緒，無法如「斥侯」去理性
思考，失去判斷力。

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)

> Recall in memory refers to the mental process of retrieval of
> information from the past. Along with encoding and storage, it is one
> of the three core processes of memory. There are three main types of
> recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall.

> Two main theories of the process of recall are the two-stage theory
> and the theory of encoding specificity.


## Types


### Free recall

> Free recall describes the process in which a person is given a list
> of items to remember and then is tested by being asked to recall them
> in any order.

> Free recall often displays evidence of primacy and recency effects.


### Cued recall

> after participants learn something, testing their memory with mental
> operations helps later recall. The act of recalling instead of
> restudying creates new and longer lasting connection ... This
> phenomenon is commonly referred to as the testing effect.


### Serial recall

> Serial recall in long-term memory (LTM) differs from serial recall in
> short-term memory (STM). To store a sequence in LTM, the sequence is
> repeated over time until it is represented in memory as a whole,
> rather than as a series of items. In this way, there is no need to
> remember the relationships between the items and their original
> positions.

> In STM, immediate serial recall (ISR) has been thought to result from
> one of two mechanisms. The first refers to ISR as a result of
> associations between the items and their positions in a sequence,
> while the second refers to associations between items.

> The Primacy Model moves away from these two assumptions, suggesting
> that ISR results from a gradient of activation levels where each item
> has a particular level of activation that corresponds to its position.

> Research has supported the fact that immediate serial recall
> performance is much better when the list is homogenous (of the same
> semantic category) than when they are heterogeneous (of different
> semantic category). This suggests that semantic representations are
> beneficial to immediate serial recall performance.

> different effects are generally seen in serial recall studies with
> humans:
> 1. List length effect
> 2. Primacy and recency effects
> 3. Transposition gradients
> 4. Item confusion errors
> 5. Repetition errors
> 6. Fill-in effects
> 7. Protrusion effects
> 8. Word-length effects


## Factors that affect recall


### Attention

> The effect of attention on memory recall has surprising results. It
> seems that the only time attention largely affects memory is during
> the encoding phase. During this phase, performing a parallel task can
> severely impair retrieval success.

> Human's attention on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary.
> Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral words
> that are spoken. ... A study was conducted to observe if the use of
> emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory.

> Recall memory is linked with instincts and mechanisms in order to
> remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator,
> connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very
> calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and
> listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other
> hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words,
> listeners tend to remember key phrases and the meaning of the speech.


### Motivation

> Motivation is a factor that encourages a person to perform and succeed
> at the task at hand.

> participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free
> report plus incentive groups. In each group, they found that the
> amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the
> group where participants were given an incentive they had higher
> accuracy results.


### Interference

> In the absence of interference, there are two factors at play when
> recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The
> recency effect occurs when the short-term memory is used to remember
> the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the
> long-term memory has encoded the earlier items.


### Context

> Context-dependency effects on recall are typically interpreted as
> evidence that the characteristics of the environment are encoded as
> part of the memory trace and can be used to enhance retrieval of the
> other information in the trace.


### State-dependent memory

> State-dependent retrieval is demonstrated when material learned under
> one State is best recalled in that same state.

> Stimulants, such as cocaine, amphetamines or caffeine are known to
> improve recall in humans.[53] However, the effect of prolonged use of
> stimulants on cognitive functioning is very different from the impact
> on one-time users. Some researchers have found stimulant use to lower
> recall rates in humans after prolonged usage. The axons, dendrites,
> and neurons wear out in many cases. Current research illustrates a
> paradoxical effect.


### Gender

> Consistently, females perform better than males on episodic memory
> tasks including delayed recall and recognition. However, males and
> females do not differ on working, immediate and semantic memory tasks.

> information presented by the women speaker was more easily recalled by
> all the members of the study ... Researchers believe this to be a
> significant difference between genders because women's voices have
> better acoustics, ranging from low tones to high tones.[57] Since
> their voices have this range, semantic encoding is increased for the
> pitches that stimulate the auditory component of the brain;[57] this
> resonates better in the ear function. Since pitch ranges from low
> tones to high tones, it draws people's attention to the words
> attributed with the tone. As the tone changes, words stand out and
> from these differences memories can be stored.[57] Recall is made
> easier since the association the brain can make is between words and
> sounds spoken.

> Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate the meaning of a
> discussion with gestures.[57] Since males follow verbal cues they
> react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to recall
> what was said, but fluctuations in the speaker's voice helps them
> maintain the memories.

> Females tend to remember a speaker's voice one week after hearing the
> speaker; they can recall exactly what the speaker sounded like and can
> recall the exact word choice used during a presentation.[57] Males, on
> the other hand, do not have that type of recall memory. They tend to
> recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are
> better recalled for men than women. The only similarity they have is
> that when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced,
> males and females tend to recall those changes.


### Food consumption

> a study of the effect of breakfast timing on selected cognitive
> functions of elementary school students. Their results found that
> children who ate breakfast at school scored notably higher on most of
> the cognitive tests than did students who ate breakfast at home and
> also children who did not eat breakfast at all.


### Physical activity

> Studies have indicated that children who are inactive have poor
> health, but they also have poor cognitive health also. With low
> fitness there is a relationship to decreased cognitive functioning;
> for instance there are different types of cognitive problems like
> perception, memory, cognitive control, and there is lower academic
> achievement.

> Physical activity has a significant influence on the hippocampus,
> since this is the part of the brain that is responsible for encoding
> information into memory.


## Phenomena

> The phenomenological account of recall is referred to as
> metacognition, or "knowing about knowing". This includes many states
> of conscious awareness known as feeling-of-knowing states, such as the
> tip-of-the-tongue state. It has been suggested that metacognition
> serves a self-regulatory purpose whereby the brain can observe errors
> in processing and actively devote resources to resolving the problem.
> It is considered an important aspect of cognition that can aid in the
> development of successful learning strategies that can also be
> generalized to other situations.


### Mnemonics and cognitive strategies

> A key technique in improving and helping recall memory is to take
> advantage of Mnemonic devices and other cognitive strategies. Mnemonic
> devices are a type of cognitive strategy that enables individuals to
> memorize and recall new information in an easier fashion, rather than
> just having to remember a list of information that is not related to
> one another.


### Tip-of-the-tongue

> A tip of the tongue (TOT) state refers to the perception of a large
> gap between the identification or knowledge of a specific subject and
> being able to recall descriptors or names involving said subject.

> Psycholinguistics views TOT states as a failure of retrieval from
> lexical memory (see Cohort Model) being cued by semantic memory
> (facts).

> The metacognitive perspective views TOT states simply as the awareness
> felt when such an event occurs and the perception of the experience
> involved.


### Involuntary memory retrieval

> two types of involuntary memory retrieval identified: involuntary
> autobiographical memory retrieval, and involuntary semantic memory
> retrieval

> Involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) retrieval occurs
> spontaneously as the result of sensory cues as well as internal cues,
> such as thought or intention.

> Involuntary semantic memory retrieval (ISM), or "semantic-popping",
> occurs in the same fashion as IAM retrieval. However, the elicited
> memory is devoid of personal grounding and often considered trivial,
> such as a random word, image, or phrase. ISM retrieval can occur as a
> result of spreading activation, where words, thoughts, and concepts
> activate related semantic memories continually.


### False memories

> False memories result from persistent beliefs, suggestions via
> authority figures, or statements of false information. Repeated
> exposure to these stimuli influence the reorganization of a person's
> memory, affecting its details, or implanting vivid false accounts of
> an event.

> An example of this is cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, where
> one duplicates a work that they have previously encountered believing
> it to be their original idea.[71] False memories can also be accounted
> for by the generation effect, which is an observable phenomenon where
> repeated exposure to a belief, suggestion, or false information is
> better remembered with each subsequent generation. This can be seen
> with the misinformation effect, where an eye-witness account of an
> event can be influenced by a bystander account of the same event, or
> by suggestion via an authority figure.


### Focal retrograde amnesia

> Retrograde amnesia is typically the result of physical or
> psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to
> remember information preceding the traumatic event.


### The Face Advantage

> The Face Advantage allows information and memories to be recalled
> easier through the presentation of a person's face rather than a
> person's voice.
