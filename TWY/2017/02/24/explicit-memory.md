# 學習：外顯記憶(explicit memory)

這篇是就外顯記憶(explicit memory) 的閱讀筆記整理。


##  實用資訊

* 心理壓力不利於形成、回想外顯記憶。
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)
* 質量優良的睡眠對外顯記憶有助益；一說是睡眠對統整外顯記憶有幫助，另一說
  主張睡眠並不直接幫助統整外顯記憶，但塑造了心靈上寧靜而適合外顯記憶形成
  的環境。
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep
* 以多樣化方式使用記憶，會記得更牢。
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect
* 在相似的情境中，更容易想起記憶。
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_specificity_principle
* 從神經心理學的角度來看，記憶是一個自動、不需主動意識的過程（但記憶的深
  淺取決於記憶編碼的方式）。


##  心得感想

* 「死背」是下策，應以「活用、應用」為主。

> the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information,
> previous experiences and concepts.


## Types

> episodic memory: memory of experiences and specific events that occur
> during our lives

> semantic memory: general world knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and
> concepts) that can be articulated and is independent of personal
> experience

> autobiographical memory: a memory system consisting of episodes
> recollected from an individual's life, based on a combination of
> episodic and semantic memory

> spatial memory: memory responsible for recording information about
> one's environment and its spatial orientation


## Neuropsychology

> Specific episodes are made easier to remember and recall by repeatedly
> exposing oneself to them (which strengthens the links in the memory
> space) allowing for faster retrieval when remembering

> remembering is an automatic process


## Factors that affect declarative memory

> Stress may have an effect on the recall of declarative memories.


## Consolidation during sleep

> It is believed that sleep plays an active role in consolidation of
> declarative memory

> The view that sleep plays an active role in declarative memory
> consolidation is not shared by all researchers. ... sleep actively
> protects declarative memory from associative interference

> More research is needed to make a definite statement whether sleep
> creates favourable conditions for consolidation or it actively
> enhances declarative memory consolidation


## Encoding and retrieval

> To create explicit memories, you have to do something with your
> experiences: think about them, talk about them, write them down,
> study them, etc. The more you do, the better you will remember.

> The conditions in which information is memorized can affect recall. If
> a person has the same surroundings or cues when the original
> information is presented, they are more likely to remember it
