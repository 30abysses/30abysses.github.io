# 學習：記憶編碼(memory encoding)

這篇是就記憶編碼(memory encoding) 的閱讀筆記整理。


## 實用資訊

* 記憶編碼方式有視覺、聯想、聲音、語義、觸覺、組織。
* 至今(2017-02-28)，記憶編碼的過程尚未被完整了解，但已知道記憶編碼的過程
  牽涉到神經突觸的生成／變動、蛋白質的合成／變動。
  * 記憶編碼的過程由短期記憶而起，轉換為長期記憶，最後是長期記憶的整合。
  * 短期記憶：生物反應變動蛋白質來影響神經突觸連結的強弱。
  * 長期記憶：神經突觸連結的新增、消失。
* 從神經科學的角度來看，增強神經元(neuron)之間突觸(synapse) 傳遞訊號強度
  的現像稱為 long-term potentiation 。
* 遺傳基因有可能對記憶能力有顯著的影響。

---

* 聯想編碼(elaborative encoding)是把新資訊與已知知識連結的過程。
  * 聯想編碼可以大幅改善長期記憶留存率。
* 語義編碼(semantic encoding) 是把感官接受到的資訊與當時情景、背景、上下
  文連結的過程。
* 短期記憶(short-term storage)的編碼方式通常主要依賴聲音記憶編碼。
* 記憶深度
  * 保留複述(maintenance rehearsal):  淺層記憶方式，焦點在事物的大略形態
    而非其意義或與其它事物的關聯。
  * 聯想複述(elaborative/relational rehearsal): 深層記憶方式，思考事物的
    意義、與其他事物的關聯，把新資訊與長期記憶中的已知知識、過去經驗連結
    。
  * 保留複述仍對學習有重要影響，但其效果會是間接發揮。
  * 記憶深度與學習意願沒有直接的關係；記憶深度只與記憶編碼過程有關係。（
    但學習意願高者比較可能去嚐試各種學習方式，進而改善記憶編碼過程，是故
    有可能間接影響記憶深度）。

---

* 「組織」是優化記憶編碼過程的關鍵。
  * 輔助記憶的學問稱之為記憶術(mnemonic)，例如，記憶口訣。
  * 把資訊片段「整合(chunking)」可幫助記憶。
  * 在接收資訊當時的外在環境、內在心境，也會成為記憶的一部分，可用來喚回
    記憶。
  * 加強記憶編碼過程的方法之一，就是把「將來在怎麼樣的場景下會需要喚回這
    記憶？」納入學習方法的考量。

---

* 記憶編碼模型
  * 辨認(item recognition): 看到事物能喚回對應的記憶
  * 提示(cued recall):  能由特定的事物喚回其它記憶
  * 窮舉(free recall):  不依照任何特定順序喚回記憶
  * 列舉(sequence memory):  能依照特定順序喚回記憶


## 心得感想

「死背」是不得已的下策，「活用、應用」才是善用「聯想記憶編碼」的良策。

易言之，想要有效把記憶編碼成長期記憶，應該嚐試各種方法：
* 保留複述、聯想複述
* 組織：記憶術、整合記憶、場景／背景／上下文記憶（外在環境、內在心境），
  並把未來喚回記憶的需求也納入考量。
* 練習記憶編碼、喚回的各種型式：辨認、提示、窮舉、列舉。

例如，以「學英語」為例：

* 保留複述：多接觸英語說、聽、讀、寫材料，培養無形的語感。
* 聯想複述：傳統學習法，從字母而單字，從單字而片語，從片語而句型，從句型
  而文法，由短句而長句，由讀而寫，由聽而說。
* 組織
  * 記憶術：這個需要再深入研究。
  * 整合記憶：所謂「舉一反三，融匯貫通」。
  * 場景／背景／上下文記憶（外在環境、內在心境）：例如，快餐店點餐的場合
    、書店結帳的場合、上台報告的場告，等等。
  * 把未來喚回記憶的需求也納入考量：例如，要練「英文會話能力」，那就不能
    用讀寫的方法練聽說，也不能光聽不說。要練聽說，就必須要用聽說的方法來
    練聽說。
* 練習記憶編碼、喚回的各種型式：以「辨認、提示、窮舉、列舉」的方式測試自
  己的記憶。

## Types

> Visual encoding is the process of encoding images and visual sensory
> information. This means that people can convert the new information
> that they stored into mental pictures

> Elaborative encoding is the process of actively relating new
> information to knowledge that is already in memory.  how we remember
> something depends on how we think about it at the time. Many studies
> have shown that long-term retention is greatly enhanced by elaborative
> encoding

> Acoustic encoding is the encoding of auditory impulses.  processing of
> auditory information is aided by the concept of the phonological loop,
> which allows input within our echoic memory to be sub vocally
> rehearsed in order to facilitate remembering

> Tactile encoding is the processing and encoding of how something
> feels, normally through touch.

> Organizational encoding is the course of classifying information
> permitting to the associations amid a sequence of terms.

> In general encoding for short-term storage (STS) in the brain relies
> primarily on acoustic rather than semantic encoding.

> Semantic encoding is the processing and encoding of sensory input that
> has particular meaning or can be applied to a context. Various
> strategies can be applied such as chunking and mnemonics to aid in
> encoding, and in some cases, allow deep processing, and optimizing
> retrieval.


## Long-term potentiation

> Encoding is a biological event that begins with perception. All
> perceived and striking sensations travel to the brain's thalamus
> where all these sensations are combined into one single experience.

> Encoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity.

> A phenomenon called long-term potentiation allows a synapse to
> increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals
> between the two neurons.


## Molecular perspective

> The process of encoding is not yet well understood, however key
> advances have shed light on the nature of these mechanisms.

> These changes include the modification of neural synapses,
> modification of proteins, creation of new synapses, activation of gene
> expression and new protein synthesis. However, encoding can occur on
> different levels. The first step is short-term memory formation,
> followed by the conversion to a long-term memory, and then a long-term
> memory consolidation process.


### Synaptic plasticity

> Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the brain to strengthen, weaken,
> destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning.  In
> the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or
> weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins
> leading to a modification in synapse connection strength. In the long
> term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a
> connection may be increased, or reduced.


### Encoding and genetics

> Human memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a
> heritable trait that is controlled by more than one gene. In fact,
> twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as
> much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.


## Depth of processing

> Different levels of processing influence how well information is
> remembered. These levels of processing can be illustrated by
> maintenance and elaborate rehearsal.


### Maintenance and elaborative rehearsal

> Maintenance rehearsal is a shallow form of processing information
> which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or
> its association with other objects.

> elaborative or relational rehearsal is a process in which you relate
> new material to information already stored in Long-term memory.

> Maintenance rehearsal has been demonstrated to be important in
> learning but its effects can only be demonstrated using indirect
> methods such as lexical decision tasks,[23] and word stem completion
> which are used to assess implicit learning.


### Intention to learn

> Studies have shown that the intention to learn has no direct effect
> on memory encoding.  Instead, memory encoding is dependent on how
> deeply each item is encoded, which could be affected by intention to
> learn, but not exclusively. That is, intention to learn can lead to
> more effective learning strategies, and consequently, better memory
> encoding


## Optimal encoding

> Organization can be seen as the key to better memory.


### Mnemonics


### Chunking


### State-dependent learning

> although the external environment is important at the time of encoding
> in creating multiple pathways for retrieval, other studies have shown
> that simply creating the same internal state that you had at the time
> of encoding is sufficient to serve as a retrieval cue.


### Encoding specificity

> to truly be efficient at remembering information, one must consider
> the demands that future recall will place on this information and
> study in a way that will match those demands


## Computational models of memory encoding

> Computational models of memory encoding have been developed in order
> to better understand and simulate the mostly expected, yet sometimes
> wildly unpredictable, behaviors of human memory.


### Item recognition


### Cued recall


### Free recall


### Sequence memory
